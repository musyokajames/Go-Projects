Welcome to my Go projects repository! This is where I document my learning journey as I progress from beginner-level projects to more intermediate and advanced ones. My goal is to deepen my understanding of Go while building practical and challenging applications.

## About This Repository

I began learning Go by exploring various free resources, tutorials, and guided exercises. As I grew more comfortable with the language, I transitioned from basic programs like "Hello World" and simple calculators to more complex web applications, command-line tools, and data processing scripts. 

Some of the projects I've completed so far include:
- Building a web server and understanding HTTP handling.
- Creating a command-line chat application to explore concurrency.
- Developing a basic REST API for managing data.

## What’s Next?

As I continue to learn and improve, this repository will also evolve. I plan to tackle more advanced projects that involve database management, web frameworks, and more sophisticated systems. 

### Learning Is Ongoing

While I’ve moved beyond the beginner stage, I’m still actively learning and experimenting. This repository reflects that ongoing journey—each project, whether simple or complex, represents another step in mastering Go.

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive into even more advanced concepts and challenges!
