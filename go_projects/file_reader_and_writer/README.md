THis area was wide so I delved deep into it with the following projects.
Here are some exercises involving file reading and writing in Go. 
Each exercise uses different types of data files to help you practice various file I/O operations.

### **Exercise 1: Reading and Writing Text Files**
### **Exercise 2: Working with CSV Files**
### **Exercise 3: Parsing and Writing JSON**
### **Exercise 4: Working with Binary Files**
### **Exercise 5: Line-by-Line Processing**
### **Exercise 6: File Copy with Progress**
### **Exercise 7: Handling File Paths and Directories**
### **Exercise 8: JSON Data Aggregation**
### **Summary of Each Exercise**

1. **Text File Processing**: Uppercase conversion and writing to a new file.
2. **CSV File Handling**: Filtering and writing selected data.
3. **JSON Manipulation**: Reading, modifying, and writing JSON data.
4. **Binary File Operations**: Reading and writing binary data.
5. **Line-by-Line Processing**: Processing and writing lines of text.
6. **File Copy with Progress**: Copying files and showing progress.
7. **Directory and File Listing**: Listing files in a directory.
8. **JSON Data Aggregation**: Aggregating data from multiple JSON files.

These exercises will help you practice various file operations and data formats in Go.
