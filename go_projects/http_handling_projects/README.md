This area was broad so I asked ChatGPT for more exercises on the topic and this were it;s responses.
Sure! Here are 10 practice cases you can try to understand HTTP request handling in Go:

1. **Basic Hello World Handler**
   - Create a handler that responds with "Hello, World!" to any GET request.
   - Respond with a 405 Method Not Allowed for any other request methods.

2. **Greeting Handler with Query Parameter**
   - Create a handler that reads a `name` query parameter and responds with "Hello, `name`!".
   - If the `name` parameter is missing, respond with "Hello, Stranger!".

3. **JSON Response Handler**
   - Create a handler that responds to a GET request with a JSON object.
   - The JSON object should contain a message field with the value "Hello, JSON!".

4. **POST Data Handling**
   - Create a handler that accepts a POST request with a form containing a `message` field.
   - Respond with the received message in plain text.
   - Respond with a 400 Bad Request if the `message` field is missing.

5. **Path Parameter Handling**
   - Create a handler that reads a path parameter (e.g., `/greet/john` should respond with "Hello, john!").
   - Use the Gorilla Mux package to simplify path parameter handling.

6. **Logging Middleware**
   - Implement middleware that logs the incoming request method and URL to the console before passing control to the next handler.
   - Apply this middleware to all your handlers.

7. **Static File Server**
   - Create a handler that serves static files from a directory.
   - Serve files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate a simple web server.

8. **Basic Authentication**
   - Create a handler that requires basic HTTP authentication.
   - Respond with "Hello, authenticated user!" if the correct credentials are provided.
   - Respond with a 401 Unauthorized if the credentials are missing or incorrect.

9. **Form Handling**
   - Create a handler that serves an HTML form with fields for name and message.
   - Process the form submission with a POST request and respond with a confirmation message containing the submitted name and message.

10. **Error Handling**
    - Create a handler that intentionally triggers an error (e.g., dividing by zero).
    - Implement error handling to respond with a 500 Internal Server Error and a user-friendly error message.


These practice cases will help you get comfortable with different aspects of HTTP request handling in Go, 
from basic GET and POST requests to more advanced concepts like middleware, authentication, and error handling.
